# NX-Eossu

This is where i will create my angular libraries under the `@eossu` scope.

[nx.dev](https://nx.dev) is used to keep track of the diffrent libraries in this repository

## Libraries

Here is the collection of libraries.

### Flowchart

This is a library to generate vertexes with connections. Between theses connections a edge can be drawn
to show the relation ships between the vertexes. Idea for this is from `node-red` tough here we will not
give any specific back end. Only the Frontend part of it.

This can be used to generete certain rule based tasks or other solutions where theses capabilities are needed.
